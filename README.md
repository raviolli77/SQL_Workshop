## Downloading MySQL Workbench
+ [Macs](https://github.com/raviolli77/SQL_Workshop/blob/master/downloadMySQLServer.md)
+ Windows - Download MySQL Installer and that should be clear enough to follow and download all necessary packages

## **Goal** 
For this workshop, we will focus on basic functionalities within a *MySQL* context. As well as some theory with respect to *Data Warehousing* to give context to attendee the usefulness of **SQL** data storage. 


## **Process**
This stucture will be similar to the [Python Workshop](https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup/Python_Workshop), except instead of being handed a dataset you will be handed a *database*. 

Databases:
+ [Northwind Database](https://github.com/dalers/mywind)
+ [World Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html)
+ [Iris Database](https://github.com/raviolli77/SQL_Workshop/tree/master/data/iris)

## **Step 1: Repository**

For this step you will create a **GitHub** repository with the following requirements:
+ README detailing
	+ List of contributors
	+ Description of data set 
		+ Along with any process taken to retrieve the data set
		+ Link to the source of data set 
	+ The problem you are trying to solve (i.e. the instructions on the file for your given data set)

## **STEP 2: Do Analysis**
Simple as that do analysis on the database you chose to use. As soon as I'm done lecturing we will branch off into temas and you will work with a team 
to make some interesting observations. 
+ Make insightful comments about queries
+ Use **R** or **Python** to go beyond (I hope most people from **DS** will do this.)
+ Upload all relevant files to *GitHub* and if time permits we can do a 2 minute showcase of people's results.
